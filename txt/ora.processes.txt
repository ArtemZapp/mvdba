Check that the service handlers (e.g. dispatchers) for given SERVICE_NAME are registered with the listener, and that they are properly configured to support the desired protocols and presentations, and are accepting connections.
You might also want to check if the number of connections reaches the database’s PROCESSES parameter using following Unix command:

ps -ef | grep oracleSID | grep -v grep | wc -l

or

ps aux | grep oracleSID | grep -v grep | wc -l

If the value found is close to the value of the PROCESSES database parameter value, you might want to augment this value using following command:


alter system set processes=new value [scope=spfile];

A database bounce is required to let the new value become active.
